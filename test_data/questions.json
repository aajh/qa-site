        "body": "I'm working on a project where I keep a log of key actions by users. For example a log entry is made when a user logs in to the application. I use a Laravel API as backend that takes care of the logging the event in the database and takes care of retrieving log entries to be displayed in the application. An example of a log entry returned for display is the following:\n\n{{user|123|\"John Doe\"}} logged in at 2020-01-03 11:00:05\n\nNow, I'd like Vue to automatically recognize that this should be replaced by the following:\n\n<router-link to=\"/user/123\">John Doe</router-link> logged in at 2020-01-03 11:00:05\n\nSo it automatically becomes a clickable link that navigates to the user profile in this case.\n\nDoes Vue offer any such functionality? Any ideas on how to approach this?\n\nThanks!",
